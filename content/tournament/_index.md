#### Format
The tournament will be a swiss with 6 rounds.  The first round will be seeded according to Lichess.org rapid rating, if a player has one. The game wont be graded, and you don't need to be a member of the ECF to enter.

After the first round winners will be paired with other winners and losers with other losers. This will be repeated until the end of the 6 round. This will result in all players being sorted in order of performance. After the 6th round the top two players will play a final. The final will be shown on a large screen in the playing hall. 

#### Time control 
10 + 5 
This means each player will have 10 minutes to make all their moves and an extra 5 seconds will be added to the clock for each move.

#### Timetable 
- 1st round 10:00am
- 2nd round 10:45 am
- 3rd round 11:30am

#### Prizes
All entry fees will be put into a pot. 50% of the pot will be put into prize money. This will be distributed to the first 3 players and the best junior in proportion 60%, 20%, 10%, 10% respectively. We expect upwards of 40 players.  The other 50% of the entry fees will be used to fund the club’s chess teaching programme in local schools. There will also be trophies.

#### Covid 
We will be following the rules of the venue  (Sussex Yacht Club). This makes wearing masks optional and requires all players to respect each other's personal space. There will be hand sanitiser next to every board and all players are asked to sanitize before and after each game.
